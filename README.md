# SENG 265: Software Development Methods

## Course Overview
Software engineering is more than just programming. There exists a set of concepts, techniques and tools that every new software engineer needs to learn and practice, and their use becomes essential once the software engineer begins working with others in non-trivial software projects. This course provides an introduction to this set, and further courses with both use and build on the topics covered this semester.
