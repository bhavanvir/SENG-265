This assignment involves writing a program to solve the same problem as Assignment 1 Part C except by using dynamic memory allocation and linked lists techniques. As a reminder, the program will read lines of text from a given file, compute the frequency of words of certain length from the file and print these frequencies to standard output. The overall goal of this assignment is to use the dynamic-memory available in C (i.e., malloc(), realloc(), etc.) as well as the concept of linked lists in C. You may only use dynamic-memory for any arrays. For example, you may not use int array[n] syntax.
